        Welcome to my Academic Life Website. I'm creating this website for my <span style=font-weight:bold,color="darkblue">Intro to Internet Computing </span>class at Florida Atlantic University. 
        I made a website previously when I was at the University of Rhode Island, but I was less experienced in coding and it did not look as
        nice. <br>

        <h4>About Me</h4>
        My name's Angelina Biafore, I'm originally from Rhode Island and 
        my whole family lives in the Northeast. One of my favorite things to do is ski! I've been skiing since I could stand and I've been to a few
        different places such as Utah and Vermont to ski. I also love cooking, my dad's family is super Italian so he's basically taught me how to cook.
        I have two dogs at home (who I miss so much) Henry and Ollie. Henry's my childhood dog, we've had him since I was 7 or 8. He's an English Yellow
        Lab and loves swimming. I actually cannot express in words how much he likes swimming. Ollie is our spoiled dog, he's a Cavalier King Charles
        Spaniel who we got when I was 17. He is a huge lapdog and is always on the couch and snores so loud. <br>

      <h4>Academics</h4>
      When I was a senior in high school COVID started, so trying to find somewhere I could go was really frustrating. I had a trip to North Carolina
      planned to tour NC State but they cancelled the touring and I was forced to choose through pictures. In addition to this, all of my tuition
      money would be going to online classes that I could do from home, so going somewhere out of state and paying tons of money was a bit out of the 
      question. <br>
      <br>
      I ended up doing my freshman year at URI starting off as a Biology Major, which clearly did not work out! I don't like doing 
      heavy memorization, and not because I'm not good at it but it just didn't feel like an interesting way to learn. I love problem solving and 
      was naturally good at math in highschool, so much so I finished 15 credits of math for college while I was in high school. I give all creds to
      my mom, she's a math teacher and one of the smartest people I know. She ended up taking classes at URI prior to my enrolling there and started
      teaching computer science at her high school. That and with my dad already working in the field, I tried a coding class there called The Joy
      of Programming. While I can't always say programming and coding is a joy, I loved that class and the projects we did and it was definitely
      the reason I switched my major. <br>
      <br>
      From there I transferred to FAU and am hoping to finish my degree in June 2024! I'm considering doing more schooling after I graduate but I'm
      not sure yet! I want to do an internship this summer (2023) or maybe research during the fall of 2023.
