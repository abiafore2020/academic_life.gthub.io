            <h5>General Information</h5>
            <p>
              Civil engineering involves the design, construction, 
              and maintenance of the natural world and man-made structures, 
              such as bridges, dams, highways, buildings, etc. 
              Civil engineers can work privately to oversee construction/repairs, 
              or publicly by ensuring safety standards and abide by local and 
              federal government regulations. It requires precision and the ability to think analytically to build safe 
              and functional infrastructure for everyday use.
